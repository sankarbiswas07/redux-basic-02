A Practice small project of redux basics :

1. No class component
2. Used local state in form (name, age) - using useState HOOK
3. Save them in redux
4. Dispatched an action to cards component which is 'connect'ed to redux's user state
5. Passing an action 'removeUser' in each user form users component
6. By clicking a user card dispatch removeUser action which will delete the user from users array
